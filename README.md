# Artillus

Playful, open-source high-resolution cartoon illustrations with flat backgrounds, created to visually represent posts from MindOff Blog.

## How It Works

1. **Full-Resolution Images**: High-quality images are stored in the `fullres` folder, formatted as `.jpg` or `.jpeg`. These images are optimized for use in web and mobile applications.
2. **Image Compression and Conversion**: The **Imagecompressinator** tool compresses and converts the full-resolution images into web-friendly Base64 format, ideal for lazy loading. A Base64 version of each image is stored in the `base64` folder under the same file name.
3. **Image Access**: Images can be accessed via raw GitHub links or through open-source CDNs like jsDelivr for efficient delivery.  
   Example: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mindoffwork/artillus@root/fullres/image-file-name.jpeg` (replace "image-file-name" with actual file name)
